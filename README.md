## 1. Introduction

This is probably the bigest/longest project i have partaked in so far. Mostly because of the time i have spent perfecting this portfolio as well as making it as unique as possible. This has been a daunting task since i decided to use Bootstrap for my portfolio, and not pure css. This was mainly motivated by the coding bootcamp i am/was part of. 

Simplicity and functionality is the design style i am more comfortable with and i am proud of how i have made such an elegantly simple website stand out.
